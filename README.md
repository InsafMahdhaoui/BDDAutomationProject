In this test project, we utilized Selenium technology to automate tests on the Orange HRM website. Embracing the BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) methodology, we drafted features using Cucumber to outline the expected behavior of the system. These features were then implemented using Java methods. By leveraging BDD, we were able to create test cases understandable to non-technical stakeholders, while ensuring coverage of some critical functionalities of the Orange HRM website.
